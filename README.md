Reactive field for Meteor
=========================

Reactive field for [Meteor](https://meteor.com/) provides an alternative syntax for
[`ReactiveVar`](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/reactivevar_pkg):

```javascript
foobar = new ReactiveField('initialValue');
console.log(foobar()); // prints 'initialValue' string
foobar('newValue');
console.log(foobar()); // prints 'newValue' string
```

So instead of `foobar.get()` and `foobar.set()`, you can simply call it as a function which (reactively) returns a
value, or call it with an argument to set the new value. Setter still returns the value.

Optionally, you can pass custom equality function:

```javascript
new ReactiveField('initialValue', function (a, b) {return a === b});
```

Adding this package to your [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) application adds the `ReactiveField` constructor into
the global scope.

Both client and server side.

Installation
------------

```
meteor add peerlibrary:reactive-field
```

Motivation
----------

The main motivation for this package is that you can assign reactive values to template instances and
[Blaze Components](https://github.com/peerlibrary/meteor-blaze-components) and then you can access them in the template
by simply doing `{{field}}` instead of `{{field.get}}`. And same for any other objects for which you create reactive
fields in the constructor and then you or have `this.field.get()` calls all around the code, which is ugly because if
you ever decide to convert `this.field` into a getter with some additional logic you have to change code everywhere.
Or you create a `this.field()` getter in advance, which calls `this._field.get()` for you, but that is again a lot of
work. So the easiest thing is to have reactive fields be methods to begin with so you can change them later on if
necessary while keeping backwards compatibility.
